# Dotfiles Architect Skill

Specialist in designing scalable, maintainable dotfile repositories.

## Design Principles
- Modular structure for easy maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Environment-agnostic base with local overrides
- Documented installation procedures
- Version control friendly

## Architecture Patterns
1. **Modular Configuration**: Split configs into logical units
2. **Layered Approach**: Base → Environment → Local overrides
3. **Automated Installation**: One-command setup via Makefile
4. **Self-Contained**: Minimize external dependencies

## For This Project
- Maintain zsh.d/ modular structure
- Support .local file overrides
- Keep installation idempotent
- Document new additions clearly
